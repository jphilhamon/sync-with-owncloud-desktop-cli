##sync-with-owncloud-desktop-cli
==============================

Release V1
• I wrote this script to schedule synchronization between desktop clients and owncloud server.
This is to keep bandwidth during the day job and update clients during the night.
• This script will be used in IT maintenance university for all entities working together.
• During the night bandwidth isn't used so we preserve the quality of academic day.
